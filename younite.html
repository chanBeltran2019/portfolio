During the production of this app,  hate towards those of Asian decent was prominent due to the lasting Covid-19 pandemic.
                             People of darker skin are still facing prejudice and given unfair treatment. If only the world was more educated about other cultures, than maybe people can start to understand one another. Then maybe everyone would be treated as equal. By giving everyone a safe place to share their culture, YouNite aims to increase peoples awareness of culture in a fun and social way. </p>

                                            I firmly believe YouNited has great significance in this society. Now is the time for people to become more aware of each other's differences and more accepting of them. If people were given a safe environment to share and educate others on their culture in a fun and positive way, perhaps individuals would be less likely to create prejudices and stereotypical thoughts about races different to them. In the end, people are afraid of things they
                                            do not understand and this would be the perfect platform for individuals to educate themselves.</p>
